5. Suppose you are developing a software that
helps tourists to navigate in the Kathmandu

valley. Your software would provide informa-
tion about different spots in the valley where

tourists may be interested. Spots could be
temples, monasteries, traditional market places,
restaurants, and so on. Declare a C++ class to

represent tourist spots and attempt the follow-
ing problems.

(a) Add member functions to read and print
the class objects.
(b) Add an attribute “rating” to the class (if
you haven’t). Rating here is a number
to capture the average perception of the
tourists. Then, add a member function to
change the rating of a tourist spot.
